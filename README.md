# STAT603-Project-1
SAS Project for STAT603 - Statistical Methods

This is the first project for my STAT603 - Statistical Methods class. This project contains two parts. In part one we are introduced to SAS. We are using the babyboom data to generate bar graphs, pie charts, histograms, box plots, and descriptive statistics. We then discuss our observations. 

In part two, we are using the calcium dataset to compare differences in measurements of calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase in men and women over 65 years of age. The measurements are performed at 6 different labs, and the results of the labs are also compared. Part two involved data cleansing as well as the above mentioned tools.
